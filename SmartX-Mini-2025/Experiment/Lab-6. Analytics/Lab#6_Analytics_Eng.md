# Lab#6. Analytics Lab

# 0. Objective

In the Lab#4 Tower Lab, we stored the resource status of Raspberry Pi devices into InfluxDB using SNMP, Flume, and Kafka, then visualized and monitored that data using Chronograf dashboards.

In this lab, we will learn how to check and manage the status of Pods, Deployments, Services, and other Kubernetes resources using the Kubernetes Dashboard.

## Difference Between `kubectl` and Kubernetes Dashboard

Although Kubernetes clusters can be operated using `kubectl` commands, the dashboard offers a visual interface that makes cluster monitoring and management more intuitive.

The web-based dashboard is particularly useful for the following reasons:

1. Real-time cluster monitoring: View resource usage and status at a glance.
2. Easy management and debugging: Create, edit, and delete resources with just a few clicks.
3. Better accessibility for non-experts: Even users unfamiliar with `kubectl` can manage Kubernetes with ease.

# 1. Concept

Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based user interface for Kubernetes.

It simplifies the deployment of containerized applications, debugging, and management of cluster resources.

Examples of actions you can perform include: `Scaling of Deployment`, `Rolling Updates`, `Pod Restarts`, and `Deploying a New Application`.

The dashboard also provides detailed information on resource status and errors, making it an effective tool for cluster monitoring and maintenance.

# 2. Practice

## 2-1. Check Kubernetes Cluster Status

```shell
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get po -n kube-system -o wide
```

When you run the above commands, you should see all **nodes** in a `Ready` state and all **kube-system** Pods in a `Running` state, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src='img/1-cluster-status.png' alt='cluster status'>

# 2-2. Install the Kubernetes Dashboard

Run the following commands to install the Kubernetes Dashboard and start a temporary proxy server.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.6.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
kubectl proxy
```

&nbsp;

> [!note]
>
> **What is `kubectl proxy`?**
>
> `kubectl proxy` acts as a **proxy** that securely forwards requests from your local machine to the **Kubernetes API server**.
>
> Since the Kubernetes Dashboard runs **inside the cluster**, it is not directly accessible from outside.
>
> Running `kubectl proxy` allows you to securely access the dashboard via your browser with **automatic authentication**, and **without extra network configuration**.

Once the proxy is running, open a **new terminal** to continue the next steps.

> [!tip]
>
> Shortcut to open a new terminal tab: `Ctrl + Shift + T`

## 2-3. Issue a Token to Access the Dashboard

To log in to the Kubernetes Dashboard, you need authentication. This involves creating a `Service Account`, binding it to a `ClusterRole`, and generating a **token**.

The following commands create a `ServiceAccount` named `admin-user`, bind it to the **cluster-admin role**, and generate a token for login.

### Cluster Role Binding

This grants the `admin-user` ServiceAccount cluster-admin privileges.

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: admin-user
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
EOF
```

### Service account

Create the `admin-user` ServiceAccount for the Kubernetes Dashboard.

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: admin-user
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
EOF
```

### Generate Login Token

Now issue a token for the `admin-user` account. You will use this token to log in to the dashboard.

```shell
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user
```

If successful, you will see a token output in the terminal like the screenshot below. Copy this token for use in the dashboard login.

<img src='img/2-dashboard-token.png' alt='token'>

## 2-4. Access the Kubernetes Dashboard

Now, access the Kubernetes Dashboard using the following address in your browser:

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/

> [!warning]
>
> ⚠️ If you encounter any issues, make sure `kubectl proxy` is still running!

&nbsp;

If everything is working correctly, you should see a login screen like the one below. Paste the token you received earlier and click `Sign in`.

<img src='img/3-dashboard-login.png' alt='signin'>

&nbsp;

Upon successful login, you will see the Kubernetes Dashboard interface as shown below.

<img src='img/3-dashboard-enter.png' alt='ui'>

&nbsp;

> [!warning]
>
> ⚠️ If you run into errors, refer to the official documentation:

> https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/

## 2-4. Delete a Pod from the Kubernetes Dashboard

Now let’s delete a currently running Pod using the dashboard. Follow the steps shown in the screenshot below and refresh the browser.

<img src='img/4-pod-delete.png' alt='pod delete'>

As shown in the next screenshot, the Pod that was deleted is now in the `Terminating` state.

You will also notice that a new Pod has been created. Since these Pods are managed by a `Deployment`, Kubernetes maintains the desired number of `replicas` by automatically creating new Pods.

### 2-4-1. Review: Kubernetes `Self-healing` Feature

<img src='img/4-pod-delete-result-dashboard.png' alt='pod delete dashboard'>

You can check the same result via the terminal:

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

<img src='img/4-pod-delete-result-terminal.png' alt='pod delete terminal'>

## 2-5. Scale a Deployment from the Kubernetes Dashboard

Now let’s perform Deployment scaling just like in the Cluster Lab.

Go to the `Deployments` tab and click `simple-app-deployment`, as shown below.

<img src='img/5-deploy.png' alt='deployment'>

&nbsp;

Then click the `Scale resources` button in the top right corner.

<img src='img/5-deploy-2.png' alt='deployment - 1'>

&nbsp;

Set the number of `replicas` to `10` (or any other number you prefer), and click the `Scale` button.

<img src='img/5-deploy-3.png' alt='deployment - 2'>

&nbsp;

You should now see that the number of Pods managed by the Deployment has increased to 10.

<img src='img/5-deploy-4.png' alt='deployment - 3'>

&nbsp;

You can check the result both in the `Pods` tab of the dashboard and via the terminal:

<img src='img/5-deploy-5.png' alt='deployment - 4'>

&nbsp;

```shell
kubectl get pod
```

<img src='img/5-deploy-6.png' alt='deployment - 5'>

## 2-6. Check Cluster Events via the Dashboard

The Kubernetes Dashboard provides real-time visibility into cluster-wide events.

Events include state changes and warnings related to resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Nodes. Examples:

- Pod status changes: Create, Scheduling, Terminated, Restarted
- Container errors: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, OOMKilled (Out of Memory)
- Scheduling issues: Insufficient CPU/Memory, No Nodes Available
- Networking issues: Service connection failures, DNS resolution errors
- Storage issues: PVC binding failures, volume mount errors

These logs are extremely helpful for identifying and debugging issues in your cluster.

&nbsp;

Now go to the `Events` tab and browse through the pages.

<img src='img/6-events-1.png' alt='event - 1'>

You can also view error-related events and analyze the cause directly through the dashboard.

<img src='img/6-events-2.png' alt='event - 2'>

## 2-7. Access Node Information via the Dashboard

Let’s try accessing node information.

You may see a screen like this in the `Nodes` tab, indicating that access is forbidden.

<img src='img/7-node-forbidden.png' alt='node forbiddent'>

### Why Can't We Access Node Information?

Kubernetes restricts access to node information for general ServiceAccounts by default for security.

The error message shown includes the following:

```shell
nodes is forbidden:
User "system:serviceaccount:kubernetes-dashboard:admin-user"
cannot list resource "nodes" in API group ""
at the cluster scope
```

This means the `admin-user` ServiceAccount does not have the necessary permissions to view node data.

#### Kubernetes Security Mechanism

- Node-level access involves sensitive information like status, resource usage, and system configuration.
- Exposing this to unprivileged users could affect the entire cluster.
- Kubernetes enforces this restriction by only allowing users with proper roles to access node information.

To view node information, you must configure additional RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding permissions.

# 3. Review

## Lab Summary

In this lab, you learned how to visually monitor and manage cluster resources using the Kubernetes Dashboard.

You practiced managing Pods, Deployments, and Services through the GUI and explored how to view cluster event logs.

You also compared `kubectl` CLI-based operation with the dashboard, discovering the advantages of a GUI-based Kubernetes interface.

## Do We Need a Dashboard in Container Orchestration?

In a container orchestration environment, the dashboard is a powerful tool that enhances **operational efficiency and visibility**.

Although all tasks can be performed using **CLI tools like kubectl**, the dashboard provides a more intuitive way to monitor and manage clusters.

Here’s why the dashboard is essential:

**1. Real-Time Visualization of Cluster Status**

- Unlike CLI outputs, the dashboard allows you to see CPU/memory usage and Pod statuses without extra commands.

**2. Easier Management and Debugging**

- With kubectl, you must combine multiple commands to check logs and events.
- The dashboard provides direct access to error messages and events.

**3. Improved Accessibility for Non-Experts**

- Operations teams or DevOps engineers who aren’t developers can still monitor and manage clusters.
- However, granting access to non-experts should be done with caution.

In short, the dashboard is a **critical tool** for enhancing Kubernetes cluster management, especially when CLI alone isn't sufficient.

## Key Activities Summary
